# Ticker

![alt text](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Third-Milestone-Project/blob/master/static/images/readme/websitemockup.png "Ticker Screenshot")

This is a full-stack site, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask framework and MongoDB. It allows users to browse and comment on stocks, as well as build their own watchlists.

Disclaimer: This website is for educational purposes only. Only a selection of stocks have been added in order to demonstrate functionality. Stocks comments are not financial advise.

The live project can be viewed [here](https://third-milestone-project-ticker.herokuapp.com).

  - [Stock](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Third-Milestone-Project/blob/master/static/images/readme/stockpagescreenshot.png) -
This is an individual stock page. It shows in depth stock information including current price, and price change / percentage change from previous day close. There is a comments section at the bottom of the page.

  - [Log In](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Third-Milestone-Project/blob/master/static/images/readme/loginpagescreenshot.png) -
Users can log in on this page

  - [Log In](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Third-Milestone-Project/blob/master/static/images/readme/signuppagescreenshot.png) -

  - [Feed](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Third-Milestone-Project/blob/master/static/images/readme/feedpagescreenshot.png) -
This shows the most recent 100 comments either across all stocks, or just on the user's watchlist depending on which filter they choose

  - [Watchlist](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Third-Milestone-Project/blob/master/static/images/readme/watchlistpagescreenshot.png) -
Contains all the user's watched stocks

- #### Data Structure

This site uses [__MongoDB__](https://www.mongodb.com//). It's database contains 3 collections: users, stocks and comments. Their structures are as follows:

![alt text](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Third-Milestone-Project/blob/master/static/images/readme/datastructure.png "Ticker Data Structure")

Registered users are added to the users collection. When they create a new comment, a new document is added to the comments collection, with that comment id added to the comments array of the corresponding stock.

-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The main colours used for the site are centered around blue and white:
        1. #1A8A94 for heading text
        2. #324B4E for body text
        3. #fff for buttons text

 -   #### Typography
      -   The font used for headings throughout the site is "Rubik". "Roboto" is used for the remainder of text. Sans-serif has been used as the fallback font throughout. These fonts are chosen as they are easy to read.

### Additional Testing

  - __Defensive Programming__- Tests have been conducted to ensure users cannot perform actions or access pages they shouldn't be able to:
    1. If a logged in user:
        1. Tries to access the sign up page, they will be redirected to their feed and a message "You already have an account" will be shown. 
        2. Tries to access the log in page, they will be redirected to their feed and a message "You are already logged in" will be shown. 
    2. If a non logged in user:
        1. Tries to access a feed, they will be redirected to the index page. 
        2. Tries to add to a watchlist, they will be prompted to log in or sign up
    3. A comment cannot be deleted unless the user is logged in and the comment was written by them. If this is attempted using the url, the stock page will reload and no comment is deleted.

  - __Flash Messages__-  Flash messages are used to confirm actions and convey messages to users. There are successfully shown:
    1. If a login attempt is unsuccessfull , "Incorrect username and/or password" shows
    2. If a user tried to sign up with an existing username, "username already exists" shows.
    3. If a new user signs up, they will be directed to the feed page where "Welcome to Ticker, Username. This feed shows recent comments on stocks" shows.  
    4. If a user logs in, they will be directed to the feed page where "Welcome, Username" shows.
    5. If a user creates a new comment, "Comment successfully added" shows.
    5. If a user edits a comment, "Comment successfully edited" shows.
    5. If a user deletes a comment, "Comment successfully deleted" shows.

  - __Form Validation__- Form validation has been tested to ensure that:
    1. If a user attempts to sign up with a username or password that does not conform to the requirements stated on the form, "please match requested format" is shown and the form is not sent.
    2. If a user attempts to sign up without filling in BOTH the username and password form, they will be prompted to fill out the missing field(s)
    3. If a user attempts to submit a blank comment on a stocks page, they will be prompted to fill out the missing field

  - __404 Error__- This has been tested to ensure that the custom 404 error page will show if the error occurs, with a link that redirects to the home page.

  - __405 Error__- This has been tested to ensure that the custom 405 error page will show if the error occurs, with a link that redirects to the home page.

### Compatibility
