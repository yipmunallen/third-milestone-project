# Ticker

<!-- ![alt text](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Second-Milestone-Project/blob/master/assets/images/quizscreenshot.png "Ticker Screenshot") -->

This is a full-stack site, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask framework and MongoDB. It allows users to browse and comment on stocks, as well as build their own watchlists.

Disclaimer: This website is for educational purposes only. Only a selection of stocks have been added in order to demonstrate functionality. Stocks comments are not financial advise.
<!-- The live project can be viewed [here](https://yipmunallen.github.io/third-milestone-project/). -->

## UX

### Site Goals

1. Create a visually appealing site with intuitive navigation.

  - [Watchlist](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Third-Milestone-Project/blob/master/assets/images/feedbackpage.png) -

- #### Data Structure

This site uses [__MongoDB__](https://www.mongodb.com//). It's database contains 3 collections: users, stocks and comments. Their structures are as follows:

[alt text](https://github.com/yipmunallen/Third-Milestone-Project/blob/master/assets/images/readme/datastructure.png "Ticker Data Structure")

Registered users are added to the users collection. When they create a new comment, a new document is added to the comments collection, with that comment id added to the comments array of the corresponding stock.

-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The main colours used for the site are centered around blue and white:
        1. #1A8A94 for heading text
        2. #324B4E for body text
        3. #fff for buttons text

 -   #### Typography
      -   The font used for headings throughout the site is "Rubik". "Roboto" is used for the remainder of text. Sans-serif has been used as the fallback font throughout. These fonts are chosen as they are easy to read.
